#Meetup Door Prize

##What it's for
Do you run a group on Meetup.com and give out door prizes?  Do you give out raffle tickets, throw darts at the attendance sheet, or arm wrestle for the door prizes?
Don't you wish there was a better way?

There is!  With this open-source project you just enter in the URL of your meetup event and press some buttons!
